### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nicholas, a senior frontend developer and snowboarder living and working in Italy.

Since 1999 I have been a web enthusiast.

In every project I have been involved with, I have tried to experiment and innovate, both in freelance projects like "Hello Ciak" (a telegram bot with over 215k users who have used it) and "Weathery Mood" (a Chrome extension with 15k active daily users), as well as in my professional website and webapp development for large Italian and international clients.

My career started at a small web agency in my hometown of Bergamo, where I learned the ropes before accepting a position in H-ART, one of Italy's best web agencies (now part of the AKQA network).

After 5 years in AKQA, I joined Caffeina as Senior Frontend Developer.
